 ## Getting started guide

To get started with AstroKit, you can clone the repository from GitHub and run the following commands:


### NPM  installation

```bash 
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shawn-sandy/astro-basics.git my-blog
# Navigate to the directory
cd my-blog
# Install dependencies npm
npm install
# Start dev server
npm run start

```


### Yarn Installation

```bash
#  or yarn
yarn install
# Start dev server
yarn start
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:4321` where you can see the site in action. You can start writing your own posts by adding MDX files to the `src/content/posts` directory. The posts will automatically be generated as routes.

## Next Steps

Now that you are up and running check our how you can [write your first post using AstorKits MDX features](/docs/1-writing-posts). You can also [customize the theme and components](/docs/2-customizing) to make the site your own.
