Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

### What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

```

Edit the content by fisrt changing the title, description, authors and tags in the frontmatter setion. Then, you can add your own content.

## Lets break it down

## Add post meta with Frontmatter

The frontmatter is the section at the top of the file that contains metadata about the post. You can add or modify the following fields:
```md

title: 'My Second Blog Post'
pubDate: 2022-07-05
description: 'An update on my Astro learning journey.'
author: 'author name'
image:
    url: 'https://picsum.photos/300'
    alt: 'The full Astro logo.'
tags: ["tag-1", 'tag-2', "blogging", ]
---
```

## Formatting content

Now, you can use markdown to format your content. Here are some examples:


```md

# Heading 1

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

# Heading 2

You can write paragraphs of text like this one and format text with **bold**, _italics_, `code` and other markdown syntax.


You can also include lists:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

You can also include images:
![Astro Logo](https://picsum.photos/300)


 

```

## So in summary, to create a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/content/posts` directory
2. Add the frontmatter metadata at the top: title, pubDate, description, author, image, tags
3. Write your post content using Markdown formatting
4. Share a link to your post.

Enjoy!
