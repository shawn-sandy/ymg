Atwell, Shawn, Kurt, and Bianca discuss the concept of God's sovereignty and how

the Bible. Kurt argues that Scripture should not be interpreted overly literally
without considering the broader context and principles. Shawn points out the
passage's disconnect from the preceding verses about love. Ultimately, they
