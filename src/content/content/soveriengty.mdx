anticipated protests and broader societal impacts. The conversation emphasized
the difficulty of balancing faith in God’s sovereignty with anxiety about
worldly events.

#### Christianity, Politics, and Hypocrisy

certain Christian groups’ support for Trump appeared to prioritize self-interest
and cultural dominance over genuine faith. They also discussed instances of
political hypocrisy and the moral compromises some individuals make for power.
The conversation extended to evaluating the integrity of politicians like Nikki
Haley, with a focus on how power often tests values and principles.

#### God’s Sovereignty and Authority

authorities, juxtaposed with biblical examples of resisting unjust rulers.

boundless love. They emphasized that while God sets systems in motion, He also

historical and cultural contexts, with Bianca initiating a rich discussion on
defining sovereignty in relation to divine love and creative purpose.

uncertainties.

sovereignty, particularly in how it shapes reactions to challenges and
expectations of divine intervention. Using the recent U.S. election as a case
study, participants discussed the difficulty of maintaining faith and trust in
