#### **Discussion Highlights**

**1. Interpreting Biblical Events of the Second Coming**

Bianca and Atwell discussed their views on biblical events related to Christ’s second coming and the millennium. Atwell shared his perspective that the righteous dead and living will reign with Christ for 1,000 years before the New Jerusalem descends to a renewed earth. Bianca raised questions about what happens to the unrighteous during the millennium, pointing out gaps and the symbolic language of the scriptures. Both agreed on the need for caution in speculating beyond what is revealed. Shawn added that there may be misunderstandings within their interpretations.

**2. Prophecy and Context in Biblical Interpretation**

Bianca, Shawn, and Atwell agreed that the purpose of prophecy is not to dissect every detail but to provide a broad understanding of the last days. They emphasized the importance of understanding the Bible's context and writing styles, which can influence interpretation. Atwell highlighted the role of the Spirit in gaining clarity, while Shawn suggested that human intelligence and logic also contribute. The group acknowledged the challenges posed by differing reading styles and personal biases. They concluded with a discussion about the Book of Revelation, viewing it as a symbolic and allegorical text.

**3. Exploring God’s Goodness and Favor**

The discussion centered on how individuals perceive and experience God’s goodness. Atwell, Shawn, and Bianca debated whether God's goodness is solely revealed in the Bible or also through personal experiences. They discussed the idea of divine favor and its unequal distribution among individuals, such as Paul receiving specific opportunities. The team concluded that God's goodness is evident both in scripture and through personal interactions with Him.

**4. Relationship with Christ and Salvation**

The team discussed the importance of having a personal relationship with Christ in addition to understanding biblical teachings. Bianca stressed that belief in the Bible should lead to a personal connection with Christ. The group debated the nature of faith and trust, with Atwell noting that salvation is not about knowing everything but trusting in Jesus. The discussion also touched on the difference between those who remained faithful to Christ and those who left due to doubts. They ended with an open question about the meaning of salvation.

**5. The Concept of Surrender in Christianity**

Atwell and Shawn shared differing views on surrender. Atwell defined surrender as yielding to God’s will and letting the Spirit guide one’s life. Shawn expressed discomfort with the term "surrender," associating it with subjugation and control, and suggested "trust" as a better alternative to convey reliance on God. Bianca proposed that "agreement" might better reflect working together with God. The group agreed to respect each perspective while considering the context and audience when using such terms.

**6. Christianity and God’s Love**

Shawn emphasized that God does not force belief but invites individuals to build a relationship with Him. The discussion included the meaning of love in Christian teachings and how it compels people toward faith. Shawn and Atwell agreed on the need for careful interpretation of biblical texts, considering their context and the importance of understanding God’s intent. They planned to continue exploring the topic of belief in the next meeting.
