Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

### What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I plan to keep learning Astro and share what I build here. There is more to come
soon. I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch
this space for more to come.

Astro is an exciting new web framework that makes building websites fast, fun
and approachable. It lets you write your site in components using familiar web
languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Astro removes much of the complexity of
traditional web development by handling things like server-side rendering,
bundling and optimizations for you. This allows you to focus on creating amazing

documentation and active community, it's easy to get started building your next
project. Give Astro a try if you want a simpler way to craft beautiful,
lightning-fast websites!
